A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between genblk1[1].ro/xn/LUT1_inst_i_1__0/I0 and genblk1[1].ro/xn/LUT1_inst_i_1__0/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#3 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between genblk1[2].ro/xn/LUT1_inst_i_1__1/I0 and genblk1[2].ro/xn/LUT1_inst_i_1__1/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#4 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between genblk1[3].ro/xn/LUT1_inst_i_1__2/I0 and genblk1[3].ro/xn/LUT1_inst_i_1__2/O to disable the timing loop
